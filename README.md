# Student Risk Prediction Model

## Project Overview
This project predicts whether a student is at risk of academic failure using statistical analysis and machine learning techniques.

The goal is to identify key risk factors early and support data-driven intervention strategies.

## Dataset
- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
- Observations: 395 students
- Features: 33 academic, behavioural, and demographic variables

## Methodology
- Data cleaning and preprocessing using pandas
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Risk variable creation (G3 < 10)
- Logistic Regression model using scikit-learn
- Model evaluation using accuracy score

## Key Findings
- Past academic failures are the strongest predictor of risk
- Higher absenteeism increases failure risk
- Study time has a measurable but smaller effect

## Model Performance
- Accuracy: ~72%

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
